What is this Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.
It's a recipe for creating a Docker container,specifying the base image, dependencies, files, and commands to run.

A Good Dockerfile must meet atleast the following needs;
1. FROM statement: Specifies the base image to use.
2. RUN commands: Executes shell commands to install dependencies, configure settings, or build applications.
3. COPY commands: Copies files from the build context into the container.
4. EXPOSE statement: Specifies ports to expose from the container.
5. CMD or ENTRYPOINT statement: Sets the default command to run when the container starts.

When one runs docker build command, Docker reads the Dockerfile, executes the instructions, and creates a Docker image.

I'm going to write a python Dockerfile in this Example.

This Python Dockerfile Dockerfile:

- Uses the official Python 3.9 image as the base
- Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
- Copies the current directory into the container
- Sets the working directory to /app
- Runs the command python (link unavailable) when the container starts.
  So, let's dive in...
